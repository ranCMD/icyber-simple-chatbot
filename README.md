# iCyber: artificially intelligent simple chat bot

iCyber is an artificial intelligence (AI) chat bot that uses neural networks and Natural Language Processing (NLP) to analyse text inputted from the user and response accordingly. The bot is written in Python and uses the PyTorch open-source machine learning library developed by Facebook's AI Research lab (FAIR). The program utilises the NLP basics such as tokenisation, stemming, and bag of words techniques.

The aim of the chat bot is to provide users with the latest information on cyber security. This can range from the user asking what the newest threats are to be aware of, top news of the day, or the user asking about specific elements of computer security (malware, viruses, phishing). By using AI instead of the user simply Googling questions the intent is that they will receive more relevant information with a personal touch. Since the bot is operating within a closed domain all responses are more tailored for the subject rather than the generalist results search engines will return. The intent â€“ as with most chat bots, is to also provide the user with the experience of asking a human being but without all the baggage of social interaction.
